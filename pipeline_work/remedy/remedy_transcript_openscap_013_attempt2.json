ALWAYS read the relevant config file FIRST with read_file before making changes.\n2. Identify the exact key/value that needs changing.\n3. Use write_file for config changes (avoids shell quoting issues) or run_cmd for sed/systemctl.\n4. Verify with run_cmd (e.g. grep) that the change took effect.\n5. Call scan to confirm the fix.\nRULES:\n- One command at a time. Do NOT chain with && or ;\n- This is Rocky Linux/RHEL. Use dnf (not apt). Use systemctl (not service).\n- Do NOT duplicate config lines. If a key already exists, modify it in-place with sed.\n- If a key is commented out (# minlen = 8), uncomment and set the correct value.\n- stderr may contain SSH banners \u2014 ignore them. Check exit_code and stdout for results."

Do NOT chain with && ; or multiline scripts.\n- Commands run as root. Do not prefix with sudo.\n- ALWAYS use read_file to inspect the target config file BEFORE modifying it.\n- Do NOT append duplicate lines. Use sed -i to modify existing values in-place.\n- If a line is commented (e.g. '# minlen = 8'), uncomment it and set the value.\n- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and verify with scan at the end.\n\nFINDING:\n- Title: Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforce for root User\n- Rule Name: accounts_password_pam_enforce_root\n- Rule ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_password_pam_enforce_root\n- Finding ID: openscap_013\n- Severity: 2\n- Host: localhost\n\nTRIAGE CONTEXT:\n- Approved for remediation because: This rule is related to password complexity for the root user, which falls under the safe_to_remediate category according to the policy.\n- Description: The pam_pwquality module's enforce_for_root parameter controls requirements for enforcing password complexity for the root user. Enable the enforce_for_root setting in /etc/security/pwquality.conf to require the root user to use complex passwords.\n- Recommendation: Remediation script: # Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms if rpm --quiet -q kernel-core && { rpm --quiet -q libpwquality; }; then if [ -e \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" ] ; then LC_ALL=C sed -i \"/^\\s*enforce_for_root/Id\" \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" else touch \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" fi # make sure file has newline at the end sed -i -e '$a\\' \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" cp \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf.bak\" # Insert at the end of the file printf '%s\\n' \"enforce_for_root\" >> \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" # Clean up after ourselves. rm \"\n\nREVIEW FEEDBACK (apply improvements):\nThe remediation script is overly complex, repeats actions, does not set the required value for enforce_for_root, and may add duplicate or commented entries, making it non\u2011minimal and fragile. Suggestions: Directly set enforce_for_root=1 or enforce_for_root=YES in a single sed replacement; Use a single command to ensure the line exists with correct value and uncommented; Make the operation idempotent by checking and replacing only if needed; Avoid unnecessary backup and rm steps; Add proper quoting and handle edge cases for existing commented lines\n\nPREVIOUS ATTEMPTS (1):\n* Attempt 1: success=True scan_passed=True\n  Commands:\n    - grep enforce_for_root /etc/security/pwquality.conf\n    - sed -i \"/^#enforce_for_root/d\" /etc/security/pwquality.conf\n    - echo \"enforce_for_root\" >> /etc/security/pwquality.conf\n    - grep enforce_for_root /etc/security/pwquality.conf\n  Scan output: Vulnerability openscap_013 not found in single-rule scan (possibly fixed)\n\nReturn tool calls as needed. End by calling scan."
