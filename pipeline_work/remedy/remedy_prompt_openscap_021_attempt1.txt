You are the Remedy agent remediating ONE OpenSCAP finding on Rocky Linux 10.
You MUST use ONLY the provided tools: run_cmd, read_file, write_file, scan.
Rules:
- Use run_cmd for EXACTLY ONE shell command at a time. Do NOT chain with && ; or multiline scripts.
- Commands run as root. Do not prefix with sudo.
- ALWAYS use read_file to inspect the target config file BEFORE modifying it.
- Do NOT append duplicate lines. Use sed -i to modify existing values in-place.
- If a line is commented (e.g. '# minlen = 8'), uncomment it and set the value.
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and verify with scan at the end.

FINDING:
- Rule Name: Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Length
- Rule ID: Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Length
- Finding ID: openscap_021
- Severity: 2
- Host: localhost

TRIAGE CONTEXT:
- Approved for remediation because: This rule is related to password policy, which is considered low-risk and safe to remediate.
- Description: The pam_pwquality module's minlen parameter controls requirements for minimum characters required in a password. Add minlen= after pam_pwquality to set minimum password length requirements.
- Recommendation: Remediation script: # Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms if rpm --quiet -q kernel-core && { rpm --quiet -q libpwquality; }; then var_password_pam_minlen='' if grep -sq minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf ; then sed -i "/minlen/d" /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf fi # Strip any search characters in the key arg so that the key can be replaced without # adding any search characters to the config file. stripped_key=$(sed 's/[\^=\$,;+]*//g' <<< "^minlen") # shellcheck disable=SC2059 printf -v formatted_output "%s = %s" "$stripped_key" "$var_password_pam_minlen" # If t
