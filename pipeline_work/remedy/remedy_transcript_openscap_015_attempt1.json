ALWAYS read the relevant config file FIRST with read_file before making changes.\n2. Identify the exact key/value that needs changing.\n3. Use write_file for config changes (avoids shell quoting issues) or run_cmd for sed/systemctl.\n4. Verify with run_cmd (e.g. grep) that the change took effect.\n5. Call scan to confirm the fix.\nRULES:\n- One command at a time. Do NOT chain with && or ;\n- This is Rocky Linux/RHEL. Use dnf (not apt). Use systemctl (not service).\n- Do NOT duplicate config lines. If a key already exists, modify it in-place with sed.\n- If a key is commented out (# minlen = 8), uncomment and set the correct value.\n- stderr may contain SSH banners \u2014 ignore them. Check exit_code and stdout for results."

Do NOT chain with && ; or multiline scripts.\n- Commands run as root. Do not prefix with sudo.\n- ALWAYS use read_file to inspect the target config file BEFORE modifying it.\n- Do NOT append duplicate lines. Use sed -i to modify existing values in-place.\n- If a line is commented (e.g. '# minlen = 8'), uncomment it and set the value.\n- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and verify with scan at the end.\n\nFINDING:\n- Title: Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Different Categories\n- Rule Name: accounts_password_pam_minclass\n- Rule ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_password_pam_minclass\n- Finding ID: openscap_015\n- Severity: 2\n- Host: localhost\n\nTRIAGE CONTEXT:\n- Approved for remediation because: The finding concerns adjusting the pam_pwquality minclass setting to enforce password complexity, which is a standard, low\u2011risk password policy change.\n- Description: The pam_pwquality module's minclass parameter controls requirements for usage of different character classes, or types, of character that must exist in a password before it is considered valid. For example, setting this value to three (3) requires that any password must have characters from at least three different categories in order to be approved. The default value is zero (0), meaning there are no required classes. There are four categories available: * Upper-case characters * Lower-case characters * Digits * Special characters (for example, punctuation) Modify the minclass setting in /etc\n- Recommendation: Remediation script: # Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms if rpm --quiet -q kernel-core && { rpm --quiet -q libpwquality; }; then var_password_pam_minclass='' if grep -sq minclass /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf ; then sed -i \"/minclass/d\" /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf fi # Strip any search characters in the key arg so that the key can be replaced without # adding any search characters to the config file. stripped_key=$(sed 's/[\\^=\\$,;+]*//g' <<< \"^minclass\") # shellcheck disable=SC2059 printf -v formatted_output \"%s = %s\" \"$stripped_key\" \"$var_password_pam_mincla\n\nReturn tool calls as needed.
