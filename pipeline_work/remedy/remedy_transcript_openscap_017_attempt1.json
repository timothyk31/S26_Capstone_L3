ALWAYS read the relevant config file FIRST with read_file before making changes.\n2. Identify the exact key/value that needs changing.\n3. Use write_file for config changes (avoids shell quoting issues) or run_cmd for sed/systemctl.\n4. Verify with run_cmd (e.g. grep) that the change took effect.\n5. Call scan to confirm the fix.\nRULES:\n- One command at a time. Do NOT chain with && or ;\n- This is Rocky Linux/RHEL. Use dnf (not apt). Use systemctl (not service).\n- Do NOT duplicate config lines. If a key already exists, modify it in-place with sed.\n- If a key is commented out (# minlen = 8), uncomment and set the correct value.\n- stderr may contain SSH banners \u2014 ignore them. Check exit_code and stdout for results."

Do NOT chain with && ; or multiline scripts.\n- Commands run as root. Do not prefix with sudo.\n- ALWAYS use read_file to inspect the target config file BEFORE modifying it.\n- Do NOT append duplicate lines. Use sed -i to modify existing values in-place.\n- If a line is commented (e.g. '# minlen = 8'), uncomment it and set the value.\n- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and verify with scan at the end.\n\nFINDING:\n- Title: Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Uppercase Characters\n- Rule Name: accounts_password_pam_ucredit\n- Rule ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_password_pam_ucredit\n- Finding ID: openscap_017\n- Severity: 2\n- Host: localhost\n\nTRIAGE CONTEXT:\n- Approved for remediation because: The finding concerns adjusting the pam_pwquality ucredit parameter to enforce uppercase characters in passwords, which is a standard password complexity rule and can be safely modified without risking system lockout.\n- Description: The pam_pwquality module's ucredit= parameter controls requirements for usage of uppercase letters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to contain that many uppercase characters. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional length credit for each uppercase character. Modify the ucredit setting in /etc/security/pwquality.conf to require the use of an uppercase character in passwords.\n- Recommendation: Remediation script: # Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms if rpm --quiet -q kernel-core && { rpm --quiet -q libpwquality; }; then var_password_pam_ucredit='' if grep -sq ucredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf ; then sed -i \"/ucredit/d\" /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf fi # Strip any search characters in the key arg so that the key can be replaced without # adding any search characters to the config file. stripped_key=$(sed 's/[\\^=\\$,;+]*//g' <<< \"^ucredit\") # shellcheck disable=SC2059 printf -v formatted_output \"%s = %s\" \"$stripped_key\" \"$var_password_pam_ucredit\" #\n\nReturn tool calls as needed.
