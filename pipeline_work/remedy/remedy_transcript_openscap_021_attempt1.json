ALWAYS read the relevant config file FIRST with read_file before making changes.\n2. Identify the exact key/value that needs changing.\n3. Use write_file for config changes (avoids shell quoting issues) or run_cmd for sed/systemctl.\n4. Verify with run_cmd (e.g. grep) that the change took effect.\n5. Call scan to confirm the fix.\nRULES:\n- One command at a time. Do NOT chain with && or ;\n- This is Rocky Linux/RHEL. Use dnf (not apt). Use systemctl (not service).\n- Do NOT duplicate config lines. If a key already exists, modify it in-place with sed.\n- If a key is commented out (# minlen = 8), uncomment and set the correct value.\n- stderr may contain SSH banners \u2014 ignore them. Check exit_code and stdout for results."

Do NOT chain with && ; or multiline scripts.\n- Commands run as root. Do not prefix with sudo.\n- ALWAYS use read_file to inspect the target config file BEFORE modifying it.\n- Do NOT append duplicate lines. Use sed -i to modify existing values in-place.\n- If a line is commented (e.g. '# minlen = 8'), uncomment it and set the value.\n- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and verify with scan at the end.\n\nFINDING:\n- Title: Configure Multiple DNS Servers in /etc/resolv.conf\n- Rule Name: network_configure_name_resolution\n- Rule ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_network_configure_name_resolution\n- Finding ID: openscap_021\n- Severity: 2\n- Host: localhost\n\nTRIAGE CONTEXT:\n- Approved for remediation because: The finding involves adding redundant DNS server entries to /etc/resolv.conf, a low\u2011risk network configuration change that does not affect authentication, filesystems, or boot components.\n- Description: Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command: $ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf hosts: files dns If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the \"/etc/nsswitch.conf\" file, the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file must be empty. Verify the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file is empty with the following command: $ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the \"/etc/nsswitch.conf\" file, then verify the following: Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured in \n- Recommendation: Review and remediate: Configure Multiple DNS Servers in /etc/resolv.conf\n\nReturn tool calls as needed.
