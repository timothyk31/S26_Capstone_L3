You are the Remedy agent remediating ONE OpenSCAP finding on Rocky Linux 10.
You MUST use ONLY the provided tools: run_cmd, read_file, write_file, scan.
Rules:
- Use run_cmd for EXACTLY ONE shell command at a time. Do NOT chain with && ; or multiline scripts.
- Commands run as root. Do not prefix with sudo.
- ALWAYS use read_file to inspect the target config file BEFORE modifying it.
- Do NOT append duplicate lines. Use sed -i to modify existing values in-place.
- If a line is commented (e.g. '# minlen = 8'), uncomment it and set the value.
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes and verify with scan at the end.

FINDING:
- Title: Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Different Characters
- Rule Name: accounts_password_pam_difok
- Rule ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_password_pam_difok
- Finding ID: openscap_012
- Severity: 2
- Host: localhost

TRIAGE CONTEXT:
- Approved for remediation because: This rule is related to password complexity and does not affect authentication or authorization mechanisms that could lock out access.
- Description: The pam_pwquality module's difok parameter sets the number of characters in a password that must not be present in and old password during a password change. Modify the difok setting in /etc/security/pwquality.conf to equal to require differing characters when changing passwords.
- Recommendation: Remediation script: # Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms if rpm --quiet -q kernel-core && { rpm --quiet -q libpwquality; }; then var_password_pam_difok='' if grep -sq difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf ; then sed -i "/difok/d" /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf fi # Strip any search characters in the key arg so that the key can be replaced without # adding any search characters to the config file. stripped_key=$(sed 's/[\^=\$,;+]*//g' <<< "^difok") # shellcheck disable=SC2059 printf -v formatted_output "%s = %s" "$stripped_key" "$var_password_pam_difok" # If the ke

REVIEW FEEDBACK (apply improvements):
The remediation script attempts to enforce difok but does so with fragile sed commands, hard‑coded values, and incomplete handling of configuration files, making it non‑idempotent and hard to maintain. Suggestions: Replace the script with a declarative configuration management approach (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet); Set difok to a recommended safe value such as 4, documented in the policy; Write the change to a single authoritative file (/etc/security/pwquality.conf) with proper quoting; Add a verification step to ensure the new line is present and syntax is valid; Make the operation idempoten

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS (2):
* Attempt 1: success=False scan_passed=False
  Commands:
    - sed -i
    - echo
    - echo
    - grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf
  Scan output: Vulnerability openscap_012: result=fail
* Attempt 2: success=True scan_passed=True
  Commands:
    - echo difok = 8 >> /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    - grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    - sed -i \
    - echo difok = 8 >> /etc/security/pwquality.conf
  Scan output: Vulnerability openscap_012 not found in single-rule scan (possibly fixed)

Return tool calls as needed. End by calling scan.
