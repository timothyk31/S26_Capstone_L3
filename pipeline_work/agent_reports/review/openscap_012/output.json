  "feedback": "Remediation successfully sets difok to 8, resolving the vulnerability, but the change is somewhat blunt and could be refined.",
  "concerns": [
    "Hardcoded difok value of 8 may be overly strict or inappropriate for all environments",
    "sed replacement only targets exact string 'difok = 0' and may not handle comments or variations",
    "No check for other password policy parameters that should be aligned with complexity requirements",
    "No explicit reload of PAM modules to apply the change"
  ],
  "suggested_improvements": [
    "Determine appropriate difok value through policy review or testing rather than defaulting to 8",
    "Use a more robust configuration edit that matches the key regardless of surrounding whitespace or comments",
    "Validate the new password policy against existing policies and test password changes",
    "Include a step to reload or restart the relevant PAM services if required"
