  "feedback": "The remediation correctly makes the setting persistent, but setting user.max_user_namespaces to 0 may be overly restrictive for containers and could cause service disruption. A more nuanced approach would be to set a sufficiently large non-zero value if containers are required, or document the rationale for disabling entirely.",

    "Potential breakage of container runtimes that rely on user namespaces.",

  "suggested_improvements": [
    "Evaluate whether disabling user namespaces entirely is required; if not, set a high non-zero value to allow containers while limiting namespace creation.",
    "Use a simple echo or printf command to write the config file, ensuring proper newline handling.",
