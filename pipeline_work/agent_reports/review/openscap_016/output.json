  "concerns": [
    "First sed command attempts a no\u2011op replacement and fails (exit_code=2), indicating unnecessary complexity.",
    "Hard\u2011coded search string 'minlen = 8' may not match all whitespace or comment variations in pwquality.conf.d files.",

    "The replacement assumes a specific format; alternative key placements or comments could be missed."

  "suggested_improvements": [
    "Use a more precise pattern or parse the file to locate the exact key/value pair.",
    "Create a backup of /etc/security/pwquality.conf before editing.",
    "Validate that the key exists before attempting replacement, and handle missing keys by appending.",
    "Use a configuration management tool or explicit pam_pwquality command to set minlen reliably."
