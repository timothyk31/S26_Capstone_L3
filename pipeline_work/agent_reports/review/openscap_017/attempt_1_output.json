  "concerns": [
    "Leaves ucredit value empty or incorrectly set, not enforcing uppercase requirement",
    "Uses unsafe sed across multiple config files with unquoted patterns",

    "Explicitly set ucredit = -1 to require at least one uppercase character",
    "Replace sed with a targeted edit (e.g., using awk or a line\u2011specific replacement)",
    "Validate that the value is a valid integer within allowed range",
    "Ensure atomic write and idempotent execution",
    "Add post\u2011change verification that the setting is applied correctly"
