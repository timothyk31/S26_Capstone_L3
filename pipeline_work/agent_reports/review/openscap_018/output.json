  "feedback": "The fix sets smtpd_client_restrictions to permit_mynetworks,reject but the remediation script has several issues: improper postconf usage, lack of idempotent handling, no verification of syntax, and no service reload. These can cause service disruption or configuration errors.",
  "concerns": [
    "Potential service disruption if the Postfix configuration is malformed",
    "postconf -e command fails when the setting already exists",
    "No proper quoting or escaping of the value",
    "Greedy grep check may miss commented or whitespace variations",
    "No verification of configuration after modification",
    "No reload of Postfix to apply the change"
  ],
  "suggested_improvements": [
    "Use postconf -e 'smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject' with correct quoting",
    "Check and replace the line atomically with sed or configuration management tools",
    "Validate the new configuration with postconf -n before reload",
    "Reload Postfix (e.g., systemctl reload postfix) to apply changes",
    "Make the operation idempotent and log any errors",
    "Prefer using a configuration management system for maintainability"
