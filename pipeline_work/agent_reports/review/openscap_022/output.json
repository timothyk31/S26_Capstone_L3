  "concerns": [
    "The parameter is written directly to /etc/sysctl.conf rather than using a dedicated file in /etc/sysctl.d/, which is less modular.",
    "The remediation script contains redundant grep checks that add unnecessary complexity.",
    "The description mentions setting a large non-zero value for containers, but the fix sets 0, which may conflict with intended container behavior."

    "Use a dedicated file such as /etc/sysctl.d/99-disable-user-namespaces.conf to set user.max_user_namespaces = 0.",
    "Remove the repeated grep commands and simplify the script.",
