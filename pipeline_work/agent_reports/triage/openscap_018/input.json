    "description": "Enterprise Application tends to use the server or virtual machine exclusively. Besides the default operating system user, there should be only authorized local users required by the installed software groups and applications that exist on the operating system. The authorized user list can be customized in the refine value variable var_accounts_authorized_local_users_regex. OVAL regular expression is used for the user list. Configure the system so all accounts on the system are assigned to an active system, application, or user account. Remove accounts that do not support approved system activities or that allow for a normal user to perform administrative-level actions. To remove unauthorized system accounts, use the following command: $ sudo userdel unauthorized_user",
