To maximize the protection, select a password-protected superuser account with unique name, and modify the /etc/grub.d/01_users configuration file to reflect the account name change. Do not to use common administrator account names like root, admin, or administrator for the grub2 superuser account. Change the superuser to a different username (The default is 'root'). $ sed -i 's/\\(set superusers=\\).*/\\1\"<unique user ID>\"/g' /etc/grub.d/01_users The line mentioned above must be followed by the line export superusers so that the superusers is honored.
