    "description": "System running in FIPS mode is indicated by kernel parameter 'crypto.fips_enabled'. This parameter should be set to 1 in FIPS mode. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 has an installation-time kernel flag that can enable FIPS mode. The installer must be booted with fips=1 for the system to have FIPS mode enabled. Enabling FIPS mode on a preexisting system is not supported. If this rule fails on an installed system, then this is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel boot parameters during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.",
