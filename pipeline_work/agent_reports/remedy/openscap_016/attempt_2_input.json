To find these documents, use\n# the command \"postconf html_directory readme_directory\", or go to\n# http://www.postfix.org/BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html etc.\n#\n# For best results, change no more than 2-3 parameters at a time,\n# and test if Postfix still works after every change.\n\n# COMPATIBILITY\n#\n# The compatibility_level determines what default settings Postfix\n# will use for main.cf and master.cf settings. These defaults will\n# change over time.\n#\n# To avoid breaking things, Postfix will use backwards-compatible\n# default settings and log where it uses those old backwards-compatible\n# default settings, until the system administrator has determined\n# if any backwards-compatible default settings need to be made\n# permanent in main.cf or master.cf.\n#\n# When this review is complete, update the compatibility_level setting\n# below as recommended in the RELEASE_NOTES file.\n#\n# The level below is what should be used with new (not upgrade) installs.\n#\ncompatibility_level = 2\n\n# SOFT BOUNCE\n#\n# The soft_bounce parameter provides a limited safety net for\n# testing.  When soft_bounce is enabled, mail will remain queued that\n# would otherwise bounce. This parameter disables locally-generated\n# bounces, and prevents the SMTP server from rejecting mail permanently\n# (by changing 5xx replies into 4xx replies). However, soft_bounce\n# is no cure for address rewriting mistakes or mail routing mistakes.\n#\n#soft_bounce = no\n\n# LOCAL PATHNAME INFORMATION\n#\n# The queue_directory specifies the location of the Postfix queue.\n# This is also the root directory of Postfix daemons that run chrooted.\n# See the files in examples/chroot-setup for setting up Postfix chroot\n# environments on different UNIX systems.\n#\nqueue_directory = /var/spool/postfix\n\n# The command_directory parameter specifies the location of all\n# postXXX commands.\n#\ncommand_directory = /usr/sbin\n\n# The daemon_directory parameter specifies the location of all Postfix\n# daemon programs (i.e. programs listed in the master.cf file). This\n# directory must be owned by root.\n#\ndaemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix\n\n# The data_directory parameter specifies the location of Postfix-writable\n# data files (caches, random numbers). This directory must be owned\n# by the mail_owner account (see below).\n#\ndata_directory = /var/lib/postfix\n\n# QUEUE AND PROCESS OWNERSHIP\n#\n# The mail_owner parameter specifies the owner of the Postfix queue\n# and of most Postfix daemon processes.  Specify the name of a user\n# account THAT DOES NOT SHARE ITS USER OR GROUP ID WITH OTHER ACCOUNTS\n# AND THAT OWNS NO OTHER FILES OR PROCESSES ON THE SYSTEM.  In\n# particular, don't specify nobody or daemon. PLEASE USE A DEDICATED\n# USER.\n#\nmail_owner = postfix\n\n# The default_privs parameter specifies the default rights used by\n# the local delivery agent for delivery to external file or command.\n# These rights are used in the absence of a recipient user context.\n# DO NOT SPECIFY A PRIVILEGED USER OR THE POSTFIX OWNER.\n#\n#default_privs = nobody\n\n# INTERNET HOST AND DOMAIN NAMES\n# \n# The myhostname parameter specifies the internet hostname of this\n# mail system. The default is to use the fully-qualified domain name\n# from gethostname(). $myhostname is used as a default value for many\n# other configuration parameters.\n#\n#myhostname = host.domain.tld\n#myhostname = virtual.domain.tld\n\n# The mydomain parameter specifies the local internet domain name.\n# The default is to use $myhostname minus the first component.\n# $mydomain is used as a default value for many other configuration\n# parameters.\n#\n#mydomain = domain.tld\n\n# SENDING MAIL\n# \n# The myorigin parameter specifies the domain that locally-posted\n# mail appears to come from. The default is to append $myhostname,\n# which is fine for small sites.  If you run a domain with multiple\n# machines, you should (1) change this to $mydomain and (2) set up\n# a domain-wide alias database that aliases each user to\n# user@that.users.mailhost.\n#\n# For the sake of consistency between sender and recipient addresses,\n# myorigin also specifies the default domain name that is appended\n# to recipient addresses that have no @domain part.\n#\n#myorigin = $myhostname\n#myorigin = $mydomain\n\n# RECEIVING MAIL\n\n# The inet_interfaces parameter specifies the network interface\n# addresses that this mail system receives mail on.  By default,\n# the software claims all active interfaces on the machine. The\n# parameter also controls delivery of mail to user@[ip.address].\n#\n# See also the proxy_interfaces parameter, for network addresses that\n# are forwarded to us via a proxy or network address translator.\n#\n# Note: you need to stop/start Postfix when this parameter changes.\n#\n#inet_interfaces = all\n#inet_interfaces = $myhostname\n#inet_interfaces = $myhostname, localhost\ninet_interfaces = localhost\n\n# Enable IPv4, and IPv6 if supported\ninet_protocols = all\n\n# The proxy_interfaces parameter specifies the network interface\n# addresses that this mail system receives mail on by way of a\n# proxy or network address translation unit. This setting extends\n# the address list specified with the inet_interfaces parameter.\n#\n# You must specify your proxy/NAT addresses when your system is a\n# backup MX host for other domains, otherwise mail delivery loops\n# will happen when the primary MX host is down.\n#\n#proxy_interfaces =\n#proxy_interfaces = 1.2.3.4\n\n# The mydestination parameter specifies the list of domains that this\n# machine considers itself the final destination for.\n#\n# These domains are routed to the delivery agent specified with the\n# local_transport parameter setting. By default, that is the UNIX\n# compatible delivery agent that lookups all recipients in /etc/passwd\n# and /etc/aliases or their equivalent.\n#\n# The default is $myhostname + localhost.$mydomain + localhost.  On\n# a mail domain gateway, you should also include $mydomain.\n#\n# Do not specify the names of virtual domains - those domains are\n# specified elsewhere (see VIRTUAL_README).\n#\n# Do not specify the names of domains that this machine is backup MX\n# host for. Specify those names via the relay_domains settings for\n# the SMTP server, or use permit_mx_backup if you are lazy (see\n# STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README).\n#\n# The local machine is always the final destination for mail addressed\n# to user@[the.net.work.address] of an interface that the mail system\n# receives mail on (see the inet_interfaces parameter).\n#\n# Specify a list of host or domain names, /file/name or type:table\n# patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. A /file/name\n# pattern is replaced by its contents; a type:table is matched when\n# a name matches a lookup key (the right-hand side is ignored).\n# Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.\n#\n# See also below, section \"REJECTING MAIL FOR UNKNOWN LOCAL USERS\".\n#\nmydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost\n#mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain\n#mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain,\n#\tmail.$mydomain, www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain\n\n# REJECTING MAIL FOR UNKNOWN LOCAL USERS\n#\n# The local_recipient_maps parameter specifies optional lookup tables\n# with all names or addresses of users that are local with respect\n# to $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.\n#\n# If this parameter is defined, then the SMTP server will reject\n# mail for unknown local users. This parameter is defined by default.\n#\n# To turn off local recipient checking in the SMTP server, specify\n# local_recipient_maps = (i.e. empty).\n#\n# The default setting assumes that you use the default Postfix local\n# delivery agent for local delivery.
