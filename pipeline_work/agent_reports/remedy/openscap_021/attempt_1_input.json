Verify the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file is empty with the following command: $ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the \"/etc/nsswitch.conf\" file, then verify the following: Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured in /etc/resolv.conf. This provides redundant name resolution services in the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to contain as least 2 DNS servers, add a corresponding nameserver ip_address entry in /etc/resolv.conf for each DNS server where ip_address is the IP address of a valid DNS server. For example: search example.com nameserver 192.168.0.1 nameserver 192.168.0.2",
