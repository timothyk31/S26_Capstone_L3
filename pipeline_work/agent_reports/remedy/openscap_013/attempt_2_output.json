The 'scan' function returns a failure result, indicating that the vulnerability has not been fully remediated.\n\nTo resolve this, you can try to:\n\n1. Verify that the '/etc/security/pwquality.conf' file has been modified correctly by checking its contents.\n2. Check the logs to see if there are any errors or warnings related to the PAM configuration.\n3. Try to manually verify that the PAM configuration is working as expected by attempting to change the password for the root user.\n4. Re-run the remediation steps to ensure that the changes were applied correctly.\n\nIf none of these steps help, you may want to consider seeking additional assistance from a security expert or the OpenSCAP community.",
